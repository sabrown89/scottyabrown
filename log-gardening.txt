  - cut 5 fig trimmings from Big L's Fig tree
  - dipped trimmings in Bontone II Rooting Powder (mixed with water, didn't measure)
  - potted in 4-inch plastic pots with Whitney Farms planting soil (organic)

2021-07-05
  - wanted to use a potting mix so I replanted and forgot to 'score' the bottoms of the trimmings to encourage root growth
  - took trimmings out and repotted with Miracle-Gro seed starting potting mix
  - before planting, I scored each trimming 3-4 times with my shears
  - keeping on the window sill of the porch which gets mild sun but is screened in so it receives outside heat and humidity

  - Planted Boston Pickling Cumbers (two different plants) in a 2 foot length, 9 inch tall, 9 inch width plastic black planter
  - Used Scotts Potting Mix to fill the bed (broke up some brick at the bottom of the planter to help with drainage)
  - 


Research
  - using bio-tone as a fertilizer to start things off
  - tomato-tone halfway through season (powder you mix in)

Tools
  - Rapid clip (soft wire ties) for securing tomato plant to stake

Figs
  - Should be roots within 3 weeks *(7-27)*

Grow:
- chocolate sunflowers
- dahlias

- zinnia (looks like blood splatter, white and red) => very easy to grow from seed
  -> can be any color really
- oriental lilly (stargazers) -> very beautiful purple / pink with a white outline, green / yellow thistle center

Research:
- potomac snapdragons (appleblossom, lavender)
- chocolate lace flower
- baby blue eucalpytus
- double-click snowpuff cosmoss
- phlox (cherry caramel, blushing bridge)
- flamingo feather celosia

- zinnia (look beautiful and small but not a lot of them per space)


Gardening:

Fall:

Meraviglia d'inverno -- Marvel of Winter. prolific winter lettuce -- https://www.seedaholic.com/lettuce-meraviglia-d-inverno-2608.html


Roses (black spot):
- Copper
  -> Winter mix of Bordeaux mix ( copper and lime solution ). You apply it after the leaves have fallen (or stripped off), removed all fallen leaves, and laid down a mulch base.
   -> It is slightly Phyotoxic (meaning it can burn the leaves) which is why we apply it during the winter. 
  -> Copper spray (not as heavy, doesn't have lime component, doesn't stick to the leaves as much, and doesn't cause any phytotoxicity)
   -> can carry over into the spring, not just the winter season
- Sulfur or Wettable Sulfur
  -> long history of use in preventing fungal infections
  -> Wettable sulfur you would do a full spray. After 25 C or 77 F, it can become phytotoxic. Don't apply in mid summer, only in spring and early summer
- Neem Oil
  -> extract of the bark of the Neem tree
  -> generally good thing to apply to roses
  -> can be phytotoxic in higher temperatures
  -> "shoulder season", spring and fall solution
- Baking Soda and horticultural oil mix
  -> "NOT" Sodium bicarbonate, it's potassium bicarbonate
  -> (1 tsp) potassium bicabornate,  ( 1/2 tsp ) horticultural oil, and a couple drops of dish soap (makes it stick) -> into 1 liter or 1 quart of water. full coverage spray on leaves (dripping off)
  -> can use sodium bicarbonate but it can tend be a little more phytotoxic
  -> will not remove blackspot but will help prevent reinfection rate

-> if you're coming into the season and looking at these less harmful solutions is to:
 -> do a stripdown at the end of the season to remove all blackspot leaves and leaves that have fallen
 -> put down a bark mulch
 -> do a winter spray of borgo mix (or bordeaux?)
 -> enter into season, do a copper or neem oil spray
 -> then at height of season, do a weekly or bi-weekly of the baking soda solution

  -> prune to an outward facing bud (bud away from center of plant, prevents rubbing, air circulation)
   -> rose will do want it wants to do anyway, may bud an inward facing one below it

  -> pots, 15 gallon pot (16 inch across)
  -> roots to shoots ratio  and bigger pot will keep moisture for longer
   -> put 15 gallon pot into another, larger decorative nicer looking pot, less heat transfer
  -> Perlite ( white bits ) free draining mix, helps drainage

- green bits -> look into controlled release fertilizers


pollinators:
Pollinators -> Seeing a lot of flies and wasps in my perennial wildflower plot, why?

 -> flies and wasps generally have shorter tongues / mouth parts than bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. They will enjoy shorter flowers so they can easily access the nectar.
 -> Mondara, blazing star, joe pye weed, boneset, cup plants, and many others with longer flower wells. ( year or two to establish these and then another year to get a large enough density of out of these varities )

 -> Anise Hyssop (basically a flowering bee hotel) -> people call ours "The Bumblebee One"
  -> a must have plant if you're in range

 -> common milkweed for monarch butterflies
 -> Black cohosh, great blue lobelia, vervain gets lots of bees

Pruners:
 -> felco bypass pruners seem to be a common mention and high quality


2021-07-24

 -> mixed 8oz of Bioadvanced 3-1 rose and flower care into 1 gallon jug of water
 -> spread across all four roses and poured some in the Black Eyed Susan

 -> black eyed susan is not doing well. Half of the plant just died off, black leaves, very wilted flowers.
 
 -> added Diamotaceous Earth to the cucumber bed

-> first planted cucumbers from Home Depot, Burpless bush hyrbid and burpless hybrid

2021-07-25

  -> made Neem oil mixture. 0.5oz Neem Oil, 1 tsp dish doap, and 2000ML of water in the sprayer. Shook it

 -> black eyed susan is doing terrible. wilting, leaves are turning black, half the plant looked like it was dead.
 -> removed it from its pot and soil. It was still pretty root bound from the peat? sawdust? mixture that it came in from Home Depot
 -> I broke off all that I could as gently as I could to expose the roots
 -> Got a bigger pot, added broken up brick to the bottom, filled with garden mix (white bag in picture) and then filled top 1/3 with miracle grow potting mix
 -> planted and sprayed with neem oil (mixture above)

2021-07-28
 -> Miracle Gro on all plants (little bit on the roses since they were already treated with the 3-1)
 -> Neem Oil spray on the roses and cucumbers
 -> Roses are getting some nice blooms (two of them are anyway, took some pictures)

2021-07-29
 -> Mixed 3-1 Rose care at 1oz / gallon
 -> added to all perenialls except for avocado plant and roses ( did not add to perennials on the side of the roses )
 -> added it since i saw black spotting on dead looking black eyed susan

2021-08-01
 -> Carrot tips
  -> loose soil, no clumps or debris
  -> not too much nitrogen, if over fertilized in nitrogen, they will spend all their energy growing big leafy tops. Phosphorus supposed to encourage more root growth (research)
  -> do no water frequently. if you water less frequently, they will dig deeper in search of water. water twice thoroughly every other day.
  -> if you direct sow, they should go straight down. Carrots are the tap root and normally pushed out of shape when transplanting

 -> better boy tipped over and bottom root (through bottom of bucket) was broken off. Plant looks like shit, like very wilted
  -> put it back up secured cage a little bit more

2021-08-03
 -> Neem treatment on cucumbers, roses, and basil
  -> it had rained just earlier before so maybe not the best time to apply it

(10 most profitable flowers)
  
  1. Sunflowers
   -> sunflowers have a lot of pollen and people dont like it when pollen falls on the surface when customers bring them home. pro-cut is pollen-free
    -> varieties
      -> pro-cut orange
      -> pro-cut plum
      -> pro-cut white knight
      -> pro-cut white light

      -> red-hedge (deep deep maroon-burgandy)
      -> double-quick (people fighting over them)
    -> sunflowers are expensive to buy for seeds (1000 for 20-30$ wholesale)
     -> every seed will likely germinate
     -> squirells and chipmunk love them, deer
      -> they'll dig up seeds and eat them.
    -> do not start from seed because they have a better chance from predators / pests if transplanted
    -> sellable stem in 55-60 days
  2. Zinias
   -> so easy to grow
   -> can plant direct seed, can get a lot out of the space, they keep going so you can pick off them all season long, they keep long, are sturdy, lots of colors, easy to sell

Roses
 -> soil
  -> like it on the clay-leaning side
   -> roses depend on a consistent supply of moisture and nutrients for the high-performing flowering
  -> roses will tolerate a wide range
    -> if on the sandy side, have to be more on top of nutrients and watering
 -> at least 6 hours sun
 -> heard better performance if you get dappled sun in afternoon since that is the hottest time of the day and they don't get stressed from moisture loss
 -> containers
  -> natural limit on resevoir of nutrients and moisture
  -> want to make that resevoir appropriately sized the best possible
  -> choose the largest size you can afford
  -> signs of moisture stress
   -> inner leaves are turning yellow
   -> poor flowering performance
   -> good sign you've maxed out
 -> fertilizing
  -> fertilize regularly (do it frequently and see how they respond)
  -> bset performance if you fertilize regularly from beginning of season, can ease off towards end of fall / winter
 -> regular water is a must
  -> timed irrigation system is the best
 -> pruning
  -> best time for pruning is early in season, later winter or early spring.
  -> when you see a rose flowering at the top or it jumps up and has unproductive wood (time to prune) -> it's not fatal
 -> pests and diseases
  -> people hold too high of a standard
  -> some black spot, little powdery mildew, some aphids or leaf damage will not hurt
  -> grouping together too many roses (or any plant) make them susceptible to big spikes in pest population and the natural predator population doesnt move in that quickly because there isnt a big diversity
  -> it's nice to mix them into a vegetable garden or other places. The bugs coming in on other plants can wipe out pests on the roses

  (side note, gladiolas also very popular and would sell out)

Bonsai
 -> repotting
  -> drainage layer at bottom. Yuga ? type of rock, yellow type of salt? but these grains will last forever. had trees in yuga for 30-35 years. ideal for drainage
  -> next layer is new zealand moss. moss will encourage new roots to grow. moss is expensive
  -> bonsai compost
   -> pine bark, peat substitute, japanese volcanic pumice, and tiny bit of akadama. akadama varies with the species of the tree
  -> lime sulphur (from japan)
   -> apply to white parts that are scraped out
   -> smells horrible (like rotten eggs)
   -> wet the trunk first (little brush in water), very lightly
 -> cut paste (apply on fresh cuttings, help heal and prevents disease)
 -> what is the two branch rule?
 -> deadwood whitener (replacement for lime sulphur? is it the same?)
-> when buds are getting fat and plump, perfect time to re-pot
 -> remove fat downward going roots to facilitate lateral growth
  -> make sure they don't have too many roots attached to them
  -> put paste on
   -> if you put it on dry, doesn't seem to absorb as quickly

2021-08-05
 -> found out better boy got a bacterial wilt after falling (root got ripped up)
  -> pictures, doing pretty terrible

2021-08-06
 -> 3 / 5 have roots for fig trimmings, one had a lot of roots
 -> added miracle gro to each little fig pot

Bonsai (growing thick trunks)
  -> learn horticulture basics, tree care
  -> using a net pot (air pruning pots) help produce mesh of roots, encourages feeder roots
  -> grow sacrifical trunks and branches to encourage growth
  -> develop radial roots
   -> when you repot, you clean up the root structure so each root radiates out so they spread evenly instead of clumping together
 -> grow your tree on a flat surface below the roots
  -> put a tial or board 4-5 inches down to encourage roots to grow radially and fatten trunk
 -> wind
  -> grows reaction wood or stress wood (has different structure of cellulose) fattens up
   -> you can exercise your tree (slightly shake it back and forth) ?? to encourage reaction wood
 -> scarring to create size
  -> cut away at base of trunk which will create bulbous growth. poke a bunch of holes or scratch off bark
  -> creates a swollen callous
 -> wire tournaquet or tap root binding
  -> wrap wire around tap root to restrict flow on tree ?
  -> the area around the wire will begin to swell
 -> silica as a supplement
  -> alleviates stress in plant
 -> grow your bonsai in ground first
  -> HUGE GROWTH

 -> technique to research -> air layering
  -> take a thick branch off a tree and turn it into a new tree by encouraging roots
 -> wrap a bag around a branch to grow roots

2021-08-09
 -> think fig trimmings are dead or have to restart. I was not gentle enough with them when just setting roots and I think I tore the roots out. The green bud on top is not as green / turning brown for all three
 -> When i added miracle gro, i think it made the roots rot
 -> moved all three trimmings to bigger pot and added raw powder growth hormone to each one (sprinkled it on) and cut off the bottom with shears. Bottom of each fig trimming wasn't green
 -> probably going to grab some new ones today
 
 -> took 3 fig trimmings from 5th street fig tree
  -> sliced into the cambian layer, dipped in hormone and put into the same bucket as the other three fig trimmings
   -> trimmed leaves off except for the top little one

2021-08-11
 -> transplanted a banana plant ? from stephanies garden, dug up whole bulb

Potential lemon meyer tree aphid, ant, fungicide prevention
 -> mix 2 tablespoons of cinnamon powder with 1/2 gallon of water, shake and let rest for a while
  -> strain mixture through a coffee filter and spray onto the plant
 -> also can put raw cinnamon powder in the base of the plant

Potential cucumber disease prevention
 -> fungicide for vegetables, active ingredient is Chlorothalonil (look into it)

Peaches fungicide prevention
 -> Bonide orchard spray (in fall?) and heavy pruning in winter

2021-08-15
 -> Neem oil treatment on the roses and cucumbers
 -> cucumbers are looking not so great, not a lot of new growth and cucumbers are yellowing at the top and golf ball shaped
 -> one of the roses is starting to show blooms!

-> old garden roses or one-time blooming ramblers -> only ones who bloom once a season

2021-08-22
 -> Miracle gro and neem treatment
 -> made Neem oil mixture. 0.5oz Neem Oil, 1 tsp dish doap, and 2000ML of water in the sprayer. Shook it

 2021-08-27
  -> Neem oil treatment on roses and cucumbers

 2021-08-29
  -> Neem oil treatment on roses and cucumbers, black-eyed susan, lions mane

2021-09-02
 -> Neem oil treatment on cumbers and roses
 -> look into adding mychorizae into the transplant holes of tomatoes, don't have to water them?
 -> what is the 'STUN' method of growing tomatoes?

2021-09-06
 -> Neem Oil treatment
 -> cucumbers are still getting bitten / yellowing leaves

 -> Autumn Beauty sunflowers look really cool

-> pretty sure cucumbers have Alternaria leaf spot. can treat with a fungicide. look into these, are there organic ones? does it destroy the soil?
 -> Liquid copper fungicides, powdered sulfur fungicides, bacillus subtilis. 
 -> Liquid-cop (brand for copper fungicide)

-> Checkout out Everwild farms for microgreen seeds (good prices, fast shipping?)
-> look into Rannuculus flower

2021-09-14
 -> noticing black leaf spot on all rose bushes, been plucking off leaves. About to add

-> If you have problems year after year with vine borers, squash bugs, and/or cucumber beetles that murder your squash just when it's beginning to produce, consider the Tromboncino Italian squash. It has long vines, loves to hang off a trellis, and makes tender (but not squishy) light green summer squash. Left on the vine, they will turn tan like a Butternut and are long-storing winter squash with an orange inside.

  The stems of Tromboncino are so tough that vine borers and other bugs cannot bite them easily to suck the juices or bore in. I've grown them two years in a row very successfully.

 -> https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/pq9one/went_a_little_overboard_with_the_dahlias_this_year/
-> how to save tubers (dahlias)
  -> Here’s my process that works really well!

    Dig up after foliage dies back from the first few frosts.

    Use a pitchfork to dig up tubers, because you can go really deep and further away from the plant so as not to puncture the tubers.

    Save the clumps with dirt on them and label the variety. Storing them with the dirt helps keep the tuber moist

    Stash them in my basement in a crate that has lots of airflow. A garage would probably work fine also.

    Finally, when you’re about a month and a half away from planting, take the clumps outside and wash them off with a hose.

    Then separate with a pair of shears and look for the eyes! (Tons of great videos on this part of the process)

    Let tubers dry for a few hours.

    Wrap each tuber in Saran Wrap! I ended up stuffing a few together and making a massive Saran Wrap tuber ball.

    Put ball in closet somewhere that’s maybe a tad warmer than where they were before.

    When it comes time to plant, you’ll see a lot of your tubers have already started to produce roots and a stem!

    Congrats! Those are successful tubers!!

-> Raised bed
 -> Douglas fir (not treated)

-> Charles Dowding (youtube) -> no dig channel

-> biggest downside to no dig is the first year. 10cm layer of compost
-> green manure crops (chop and drop?)

-> Fig propagation
 -> hardwood cuttings between October and February
 -> cuttings that are 4-6 inches long and have at least 2 nodes on them
 -> you don't want any fertilizer or nutrients in the soil you put them in. It needs a Sterile Mix
   -> the nitrogen will cause them to rot since they can't take up the nutrients in a charged soil.
 -> preferred media is a washed coconut coir and perlite with a ratio of around 30-40% coconut coir to 60-70% perlite. coconut retains moisture while perlite provides aeration to keep the media from going anaerobic
 -> err on the side of dry to prevent rotting
 -> scrape a thin layer of bark away at the bottom of the cutting
 -> if you do use a growth hormone, we recommend a low strength hormone
 -> We space our cuttings about an inch and a half or two inches apart and buried about half to two thirds of their length in the media. Once all your cuttings are set you can place it on a heating mat or in a warm space. We’ve heard of some folks using the top of their refrigerator to root cuttings as it gives off some heat, but anywhere that stays around 75-80 degrees will work.
 -> they don't require light until they start producing leaves
 -> should see buds start to open in about a month
 -> typically wait two months before potting them in a lightly charged media since they are prone to collapsing if potted too early
 -> common practice for naming an unknown variety is to name it by where it's found and include "unk" at the end. 5th street Unk
 -> cuttings should be 1/2" to 3/4" thick
 -> 50% sand and 50% peat moss
 coconut coir -> 11lbs, 13$ -> home depot
 -> happy frog potting mix, james prigioni favorite brand
 -> high humidity, can put a large plastic storage container over the plants. want them in a warm spot in the house
 -> can also wrap with damp paper towel and put it in a plastic bag. wait for roots to grow and then put in potting mix
 -> 8qt for 15.99 -> $2 a quart

 2021-09-28
  -> rose poison 3-2-1 (or whatever it's called) 4oz mixed with 1/2 gallon of water across all 4 plants.
  -> roses were starting to show some pretty developed black spot

-> morels
 -> look for ash trees / (more specifically elms) or where a dead elm was


 -> look at osteopermums; Africa daisies

 -> lookup what green manure crops are, supposed to help amend clay soil really well

 -> rosetone is good for Hydrangeas
 -> Brandywine tomatoes

 -> companion plants email

 -> Epic gardening early tomato variety; glacier ?
