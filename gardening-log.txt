  - wanted to use a potting mix so I replanted and forgot to 'score' the bottoms of the trimmings to encourage root growth
  - took trimmings out and repotted with Miracle-Gro seed starting potting mix
  - before planting, I scored each trimming 3-4 times with my shears
  - keeping on the window sill of the porch which gets mild sun but is screened in so it receives outside heat and humidity

  - Planted Boston Pickling Cumbers (two different plants) in a 2 foot length, 9 inch tall, 9 inch width plastic black planter
  - Used Scotts Potting Mix to fill the bed (broke up some brick at the bottom of the planter to help with drainage)
  -
