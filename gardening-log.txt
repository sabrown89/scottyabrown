  - cut 5 fig trimmings from Big L's Fig tree
  - dipped trimmings in Bontone II Rooting Powder (mixed with water, didn't measure)
  - potted in 4-inch plastic pots with Whitney Farms planting soil (organic)

2021-07-05
  - wanted to use a potting mix so I replanted and forgot to 'score' the bottoms of the trimmings to encourage root growth
  - took trimmings out and repotted with Miracle-Gro seed starting potting mix
  - before planting, I scored each trimming 3-4 times with my shears
  - keeping on the window sill of the porch which gets mild sun but is screened in so it receives outside heat and humidity

  - Planted Boston Pickling Cumbers (two different plants) in a 2 foot length, 9 inch tall, 9 inch width plastic black planter
  - Used Scotts Potting Mix to fill the bed (broke up some brick at the bottom of the planter to help with drainage)
  - 


Research
  - using bio-tone as a fertilizer to start things off
  - tomato-tone halfway through season (powder you mix in)

Tools
  - Rapid clip (soft wire ties) for securing tomato plant to stake

Figs
  - Should be roots within 3 weeks *(7-27)*

Grow:
- chocolate sunflowers
- dahlias

- zinnia (looks like blood splatter, white and red) => very easy to grow from seed
  -> can be any color really
- oriental lilly (stargazers) -> very beautiful purple / pink with a white outline, green / yellow thistle center

Research:
- potomac snapdragons (appleblossom, lavender)
- chocolate lace flower
- baby blue eucalpytus
- double-click snowpuff cosmoss
- phlox (cherry caramel, blushing bridge)
- flamingo feather celosia

- zinnia (look beautiful and small but not a lot of them per space)


Gardening:

Fall:

Meraviglia d'inverno -- Marvel of Winter. prolific winter lettuce -- https://www.seedaholic.com/lettuce-meraviglia-d-inverno-2608.html


Roses (black spot):
- Copper
  -> Winter mix of Bordeaux mix ( copper and lime solution ). You apply it after the leaves have fallen (or stripped off), removed all fallen leaves, and laid down a mulch base.
   -> It is slightly Phyotoxic (meaning it can burn the leaves) which is why we apply it during the winter. 
  -> Copper spray (not as heavy, doesn't have lime component, doesn't stick to the leaves as much, and doesn't cause any phytotoxicity)
   -> can carry over into the spring, not just the winter season
- Sulfur or Wettable Sulfur
  -> long history of use in preventing fungal infections
  -> Wettable sulfur you would do a full spray. After 25 C or 77 F, it can become phytotoxic. Don't apply in mid summer, only in spring and early summer
- Neem Oil
  -> extract of the bark of the Neem tree
  -> generally good thing to apply to roses
  -> can be phytotoxic in higher temperatures
  -> "shoulder season", spring and fall solution
- Baking Soda and horticultural oil mix
  -> "NOT" Sodium bicarbonate, it's potassium bicarbonate
  -> (1 tsp) potassium bicabornate,  ( 1/2 tsp ) horticultural oil, and a couple drops of dish soap (makes it stick) -> into 1 liter or 1 quart of water. full coverage spray on leaves (dripping off)
  -> can use sodium bicarbonate but it can tend be a little more phytotoxic
  -> will not remove blackspot but will help prevent reinfection rate

-> if you're coming into the season and looking at these less harmful solutions is to:
 -> do a stripdown at the end of the season to remove all blackspot leaves and leaves that have fallen
 -> put down a bark mulch
 -> do a winter spray of borgo mix (or bordeaux?)
 -> enter into season, do a copper or neem oil spray
 -> then at height of season, do a weekly or bi-weekly of the baking soda solution

  -> prune to an outward facing bud (bud away from center of plant, prevents rubbing, air circulation)
   -> rose will do want it wants to do anyway, may bud an inward facing one below it

  -> pots, 15 gallon pot (16 inch across)
  -> roots to shoots ratio  and bigger pot will keep moisture for longer
   -> put 15 gallon pot into another, larger decorative nicer looking pot, less heat transfer
  -> Perlite ( white bits ) free draining mix, helps drainage

- green bits -> look into controlled release fertilizers


pollinators:
Pollinators -> Seeing a lot of flies and wasps in my perennial wildflower plot, why?

 -> flies and wasps generally have shorter tongues / mouth parts than bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. They will enjoy shorter flowers so they can easily access the nectar.
 -> Mondara, blazing star, joe pye weed, boneset, cup plants, and many others with longer flower wells. ( year or two to establish these and then another year to get a large enough density of out of these varities )

 -> Anise Hyssop (basically a flowering bee hotel) -> people call ours "The Bumblebee One"
  -> a must have plant if you're in range

 -> common milkweed for monarch butterflies
 -> Black cohosh, great blue lobelia, vervain gets lots of bees

Pruners:
 -> felco bypass pruners seem to be a common mention and high quality


2021-07-24

 -> mixed 8oz of Bioadvanced 3-1 rose and flower care into 1 gallon jug of water
 -> spread across all four roses and poured some in the Black Eyed Susan

 -> black eyed susan is not doing well. Half of the plant just died off, black leaves, very wilted flowers.
 
 -> added Diamotaceous Earth to the cucumber bed

-> first planted cucumbers from Home Depot, Burpless bush hyrbid and burpless hybrid

2021-07-25

  -> made Neem oil mixture. 0.5oz Neem Oil, 1 tsp dish doap, and 2000ML of water in the sprayer. Shook it

 -> black eyed susan is doing terrible. wilting, leaves are turning black, half the plant looked like it was dead.
 -> removed it from its pot and soil. It was still pretty root bound from the peat? sawdust? mixture that it came in from Home Depot
 -> I broke off all that I could as gently as I could to expose the roots
 -> Got a bigger pot, added broken up brick to the bottom, filled with garden mix (white bag in picture) and then filled top 1/3 with miracle grow potting mix
 -> planted and sprayed with neem oil (mixture above)

2021-07-28
 -> Miracle Gro on all plants (little bit on the roses since they were already treated with the 3-1)
 -> Neem Oil spray on the roses and cucumbers
 -> Roses are getting some nice blooms (two of them are anyway, took some pictures)

2021-07-29
 -> Mixed 3-1 Rose care at 1oz / gallon
 -> added to all perenialls except for avocado plant and roses ( did not add to perennials on the side of the roses )
 -> added it since i saw black spotting on dead looking black eyed susan

2021-08-01
 -> Carrot tips
  -> loose soil, no clumps or debris
  -> not too much nitrogen, if over fertilized in nitrogen, they will spend all their energy growing big leafy tops. Phosphorus supposed to encourage more root growth (research)
  -> do no water frequently. if you water less frequently, they will dig deeper in search of water. water twice thoroughly every other day.
  -> if you direct sow, they should go straight down. Carrots are the tap root and normally pushed out of shape when transplanting

 -> better boy tipped over and bottom root (through bottom of bucket) was broken off. Plant looks like shit, like very wilted
  -> put it back up secured cage a little bit more

2021-08-03
 -> Neem treatment on cucumbers, roses, and basil
  -> it had rained just earlier before so maybe not the best time to apply it

(10 most profitable flowers)
  
  1. Sunflowers
   -> sunflowers have a lot of pollen and people dont like it when pollen falls on the surface when customers bring them home. pro-cut is pollen-free
    -> varieties
      -> pro-cut orange
      -> pro-cut plum
      -> pro-cut white knight
      -> pro-cut white light

      -> red-hedge (deep deep maroon-burgandy)
      -> double-quick (people fighting over them)
    -> sunflowers are expensive to buy for seeds (1000 for 20-30$ wholesale)
     -> every seed will likely germinate
     -> squirells and chipmunk love them, deer
      -> they'll dig up seeds and eat them.
    -> do not start from seed because they have a better chance from predators / pests if transplanted
    -> sellable stem in 55-60 days
  2. Zinias
   -> so easy to grow
   -> can plant direct seed, can get a lot out of the space, they keep going so you can pick off them all season long, they keep long, are sturdy, lots of colors, easy to sell

Roses
 -> soil
  -> like it on the clay-leaning side
   -> roses depend on a consistent supply of moisture and nutrients for the high-performing flowering
  -> roses will tolerate a wide range
    -> if on the sandy side, have to be more on top of nutrients and watering
 -> at least 6 hours sun
 -> heard better performance if you get dappled sun in afternoon since that is the hottest time of the day and they don't get stressed from moisture loss
 -> containers
  -> natural limit on resevoir of nutrients and moisture
  -> want to make that resevoir appropriately sized the best possible
  -> choose the largest size you can afford
  -> signs of moisture stress
   -> inner leaves are turning yellow
   -> poor flowering performance
   -> good sign you've maxed out
 -> fertilizing
  -> fertilize regularly (do it frequently and see how they respond)
  -> bset performance if you fertilize regularly from beginning of season, can ease off towards end of fall / winter
 -> regular water is a must
  -> timed irrigation system is the best
 -> pruning
  -> best time for pruning is early in season, later winter or early spring.
  -> when you see a rose flowering at the top or it jumps up and has unproductive wood (time to prune) -> it's not fatal
 -> pests and diseases
  -> people hold too high of a standard
  -> some black spot, little powdery mildew, some aphids or leaf damage will not hurt
  -> grouping together too many roses (or any plant) make them susceptible to big spikes in pest population and the natural predator population doesnt move in that quickly because there isnt a big diversity
  -> it's nice to mix them into a vegetable garden or other places. The bugs coming in on other plants can wipe out pests on the roses

  (side note, gladiolas also very popular and would sell out)

Bonsai
 -> repotting
  -> drainage layer at bottom. Yuga ? type of rock, yellow type of salt? but these grains will last forever. had trees in yuga for 30-35 years. ideal for drainage
  -> next layer is new zealand moss. moss will encourage new roots to grow. moss is expensive
  -> bonsai compost
   -> pine bark, peat substitute, japanese volcanic pumice, and tiny bit of akadama. akadama varies with the species of the tree
  -> lime sulphur (from japan)
   -> apply to white parts that are scraped out
   -> smells horrible (like rotten eggs)
   -> wet the trunk first (little brush in water), very lightly
 -> cut paste (apply on fresh cuttings, help heal and prevents disease)
 -> what is the two branch rule?
 -> deadwood whitener (replacement for lime sulphur? is it the same?)
-> when buds are getting fat and plump, perfect time to re-pot
 -> remove fat downward going roots to facilitate lateral growth
  -> make sure they don't have too many roots attached to them
  -> put paste on
   -> if you put it on dry, doesn't seem to absorb as quickly

2021-08-05
 -> found out better boy got a bacterial wilt after falling (root got ripped up)
  -> pictures, doing pretty terrible

2021-08-06
 -> 3 / 5 have roots for fig trimmings, one had a lot of roots
 -> added miracle gro to each little fig pot
